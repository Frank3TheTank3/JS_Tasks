//Your top choices

/*

    Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
    For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
    Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", 
    picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.
